# Exploring-Weather-Trends
Project from UDACITY Data Analyst nano degree 

In this project, we will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in Munich to overall global temperature trends.

Pre-requisites:
1. A spreadsheet app like Excel or google sheets.


To get started ,follow the steps below:

1. Load the data from the City level and global data CSV files, into your spreadsheet.
2. Create a line chart that compares Munich's temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable .
3. Plot the data and make obervations.
